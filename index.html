          How did Luffy got that scar under his left eye?
        </button>
        <div id="answer" class="answer">
          <p>
            This was explained in the manga. When Luffy was a kid, he stabbed
            himself under the eye to prove to Red-Haired Shanks that he was a
            man. That scene was excluded from the anime.

        </button>
        <div id="answer" class="answer">
          <p>
            Any characters that have a "D." for a middle initial are part of the
            "Will of D". It's meaning is yet to be revealed!
